 `insertion_sort` algorithm step by step for the array `[8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]`:

Iteration 1:
- `key = 4`
- Compare `4` with `8`. Since `4` is smaller, we shift `8` to the right.
- `arr = [8, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Update `j = 0`
- Insert `key` at the correct position.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`

Iteration 2:
- `key = 23`
- Compare `23` with `8`. Since `23` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Update `j = 1`
- Compare `23` with `4`. Since `23` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Insert `key` at the correct position.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`

Iteration 3:
- `key = 42`
- Compare `42` with `23`. Since `42` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Update `j = 2`
- Compare `42` with `8`. Since `42` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Compare `42` with `4`. Since `42` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`
- Insert `key` at the correct position.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 16, 15]`

Iteration 4:
- `key = 16`
- Compare `16` with `42`. Since `16` is smaller, we shift `42` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 42, 42, 15]`
- Update `j = 3`
- Compare `16` with `23`. Since `16` is smaller, we shift `23` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 23, 42, 15]`
- Update `j = 2`
- Compare `16` with `8`. Since `16` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 23, 42, 15]`
- Compare `16` with `4`. Since `16` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 23, 23, 42, 15]`
- Insert `key` at the correct position.
- `arr = [4, 8, 16, 23, 42, 15]`

Iteration 5:
- `key = 15`
- Compare `15` with `42`. Since `15` is smaller, we shift `42` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 16, 23, 42, 42]`
- Update `j = 4`
- Compare `15` with `23`. Since `15` is smaller, we shift `23` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 16, 23, 23, 42]`
- Update `j = 3`
- Compare `15` with `16`. Since `15` is smaller, we shift `16` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 16, 16, 23, 42]`
- Update `j = 2`
- Compare `15` with `8`. Since `15` is smaller, we shift `8` to the right.
- `arr = [4, 8, 8, 16, 23, 42]`
- Update `j = 1`
- Compare `15` with `4`. Since `15` is larger, we don't shift any elements.
- `arr = [4, 8, 8, 16, 23, 42]`
- Insert `key` at the correct position.
- `arr = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`

After the iterations, the sorted array is `[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]`.
 

## efficiency
The efficiency of the Insertion Sort algorithm can be analyzed in terms of its time complexity and space complexity.

Time Complexity:
- Worst case: O(n^2) when the input array is in reverse sorted order. In the worst case, the algorithm requires n-1 comparisons and shifts for each element, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(1) because it performs in-place sorting. It does not require any additional space proportional to the input size.




```

def insert(sorted_list, value):
    i = 0
    while value > sorted_list[i]:
        i += 1
    while i < len(sorted_list):
        temp = sorted_list[i]
        sorted_list[i] = value
        value = temp
        i += 1
    sorted_list.append(value)
    return sorted_list


def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr
